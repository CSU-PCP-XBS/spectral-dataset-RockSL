# spectral-dataset-RockSL
an integrated open mineral spectral library from shared libraries (USGS,JHU,JPL,ASU,MISA, etc.) and measurement spectra in our own laboratory. We hope that more researchers will join to improve the availability and practical value of RockSL for remote sensing community. 

This work is mainly to unify the format and semantics of spectral data of each shared spectral library and tested data. If there exists the problem with  quality of shared data , please contact original developers or visit related website. Besides, if the RockSL is cited in your scientific research projects or papers, please pay attention to cite the relevant works of shared database creators (you can get in touch with me or go to the corresponding official website).

We will upload and collect more relevant open source and test spectrum data and update them later, and upload the SQL SERVER storage file (this data set is built based on SQL server).
