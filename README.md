# spectral-dataset-RockSL
 an integrated open mineral spectral library from shared libraries (USGS,JHU,JPL,ASU,MISA, etc.) and measurement spectra in our own laboratory.
 We will upload and collect more relevant open source and test spectrum data and update them later, and upload the SQL SERVER storage file (this data set is built based on SQL server)
